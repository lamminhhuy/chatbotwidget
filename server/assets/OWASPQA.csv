"16. How do you access the features of OWASP ZAP?"
"Users looking to take full advantage of OWASP ZAP must have installed and updated all relevant add-ons."
"17. What is the purpose of the active scanning policy?"
"Active scanning policies allow users to customise and assign various tasks such as Dom Access data gathering or HD Directory browsing, as well as set threshold and strength requirements for their scanner's scan speed."
"18. What is the process for scanning a Moodle application using a Firefox headless browser?"
"The author reviews each application until results become available, pausing at various intervals during that scan to examine any alerts and document any findings that arise from their examination of signals generated during scanning."
"19. What types of alerts are displayed in the scanned results?"
"Scan results show various alerts for high findings, red flags indicate significant findings, and orange and yellow represent medium findings, with blue serving as informational flags for low results and blue marking informational purposes."
"20. Running these tools against websites is dangerous and illegal. Why?"
"Running these tools against websites can be dangerous and illegal for several reasons: hacking is prohibited under federal law, and running these tools against websites you do not own could bring down their servers entirely."
"21. What is the purpose of spidering a website?"
"Spidering is an automated method for exploring and indexing its content and structure for search engine indexing purposes."
"It usually requires crawling scripts that run periodically until search engine bots have successfully crawled the content."
"22.What is an active scan?"
"An active scan is a vulnerability assessment conducted by injecting payloads into websites or systems to identify potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities and pinpoint improvement areas."
"23.What are some of the columns included in an active scan of a website?"
"An active scan typically includes columns such as ID, request timestamp, response timestamp, method used, URL method code RTT header, RTT response header, etc."
"24.How long does an active scan typically take?"
"The timing for an active scan to complete can depend on the scope and complexity of the website being tested; time may need to pass for the scanner to index all payloads on it before beginning an analysis process."
"25.What happens after completing an active scan of a website?"
"After performing an active scan, an author should typically be taken to an alert page displaying any vulnerabilities or potential attacks identified during their scan."
"26.What is the purpose of website penetration testing?"
"Penetration testing identifies vulnerabilities and possible attacks to assess website or system security and integrity."
"27. What information is displayed on the alert page on the bottom left side of OWASP ZAP?"
"The Alert Page displays information related to cross-site scripting, remote file inclusion directory browsing and x-frame options."
"28. How can users expand the alert to check for vulnerabilities?"
"Users can broaden the scope of a signal by double-clicking any of its details; for instance, users could double-click a cross-site scripting DOM base entry and verify whether a website is vulnerable."
"29. What will the URL show when a user checks if a website is vulnerable?"
"It will display high, medium, and attack payload risks for path-to-vessel attack techniques."
"30. What is the purpose of the URL?"
"An URL allows attackers to access files, directories and commands outside the web document root directory."
"31.How can website owners address the issue of the URL?"
"When faced with URL security threats, website owners have several methods available to mitigate risk: harden the application or update their server; introduce web application firewall protection into the front of their websites; or set their applications against attacks directly by users."
"32. What are the main features of ZAP?"
"ZAP features several main elements, such as an intercepting proxy, spider web crawlers, passive scanners, and active scanners."
"33. What does the intercepting proxy do in ZAP?"
"ZAP's intercepting proxy is an intermediary between your browser and web applications - any messages directed towards web apps go through its intercepting proxy."
"34. What is the difference between the passive and active scanners in ZAP?"
"Passive scanners examine requests and responses sent between browser and application without initiating attacks or performing other exploits."
"Active scanning reads requests and responses and performs attacks against applications being tested. Before performing an active scan on any given application, ensure you have permission from its creator before beginning testing."
"35. When should the passive scanner be used in ZAP?"
"ZAP's passive scanner should be utilised to examine requests and responses between browser and application without performing any attacks on it."
"36. What is ZAP used for?"
"ZAP is an effective web application security scanner capable of finding vulnerabilities within web applications."
"37. Can ZAP be used to fuzz parameters?"
"ZAP may also be utilised as an effective means to uncover additional threats not picked up by other scanners."
"38. What is fuzzing?"
"Fuzzing is a technique employed in software testing that intentionally introduces errors or unexpected input into systems to test for their resilience and identify any vulnerabilities."
"39. Does ZAP support dynamic SSL certificates?"
"ZAP supports dynamic SSL certificates, making it possible to generate unique root certificates that intercept HTTPS traffic and intercept it for interception by ZAP."
